we use props to pass data down from component tree to child component 
like menu where we accessed pizza component ie menu being parent we add the data in menu component
then that data is accessed in pizza component using props that gives us that data
in object from

using props we can onlt move data from parent to child ie from top to bottom not the other way

react renders a component based on current data and ui is kept in sync with that data
component has data logic and appearance
data has props and state
state is internal data that can be updated using component logic and props are data coming from parent component

props are read only i.e they cant be updated to update them we need state 

when we update using state the intiql value is also updated 

one-way-data-flow
data can only be passed from parent to children
